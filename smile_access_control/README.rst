This module allows to manage users' rights using profiles.

Odoo's groups are a coherent set of rules that are functionally consistent. Profiles allow you to combine several groups and effectively tailor users' access to each user.

Here is an exemple :

* accounting group : create an invoice, modify an invoice, cancel an invoice
* business develloper group : create a lead, modify data of lead, close a deal

The CEO of an SME will probably belong to both groups. Profiles allow to combine the both groups in one profile.

This is an alternative way to manage users rights by functional profiles.

Basically, a « profile » is a fictive user (res.users) tagged as a profile.

It means that like before (with the basic rules of Odoo),
you can add groups to your profile.

Features:

* You can associate a profile to created users.
* You can add users by profile.
* You can set fields to update for linked users.
* You have the choice to update or not in write mode for associated users,
  with field 'Update users' in profiles.
